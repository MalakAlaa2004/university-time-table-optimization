# university-time-table-optimization
this project is part of my evolutionary algorithm course project as an artificial intelligence departement student 
at faculty of computer science and artificial intteligence at helwan university
this project is done in contribution with my teammates and tasks was assigned as following :
malak---> simulated annealing algorithm 
    ---->ABC algorithm
    ---->project docuentation
    ----> summerization of referenced research paper
Nancy--->simple genetic algorithm 
      ---->GA memetic
      --->GA cultural 
      --->documente test result
farha --->gui
      --->hybrid PCO+ SA
      --->documente test result
bassmala & rawda--->PCO algorithm
                 --->hybrid PCO+GA
                 --->document pco +hybrid
